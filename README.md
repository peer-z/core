# Peer-Z Core

## Purpose

This project's purpose is to install a peer-to-peer layer that will allow people to communicate securely and anonymously over the Internet. It will offer based services, like mail-like and instant messaging, profile and personal web servers, along with a game of checkers and one of chess - for a start.

The Core layer will be expandable through new services that can be developed and implemented separately, and authorized through the core.

## Next Steps

This README will be updated in time.

# Peer-Z Core

## Purpose

This project's purpose is to install a peer-to-peer layer that will allow people to communicate securely and anonymously over the Internet. It will offer based services, like mail-like and instant messaging, profile and personal web servers, along with a game of checkers and one of chess - for a start.

The Core layer will be expandable through new services that can be developed and implemented separately, and authorized through the core.

## Usage

- Install go
- run `go build` in the main folder
- run `./peer-z`

### Installing

- run `go install`
- just run `peer-z`

## Next Steps

This README will be updated in time.

A proper install process will also be provided at a later time, with the official release

## IMPORTANT

Remember Peer-Z is currently being developed and may not be stable or even functional.
You're testing it at your own risk, only do it if you know what you're doing.

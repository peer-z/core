# Admin template

## Notes

The admin template comes pre-compiled, so you don't have to do anything after building and installing the go executable.
You'll have to update the `dist` folder if you make any changes to the files in `src`

## How to compile the admin template

run `npm install` in the `admin` folder, followed by `npm run build`.
If you need to test your changes, run `npm run watch` instead and the changes will be applied immediately.
